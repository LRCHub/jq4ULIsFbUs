How many times has psychology
Made you analyze what you should be
And how many times has some philosophy
Made you spin around, too dizzy to see
And how many times have we looked too deep
For what we should have seen so obviously
Tell me...

Does anybody know what makes the wind blow
And can you tell me why the rain falls from the sky
If we really want to know all the answers
They're in the Treasures of Heaven

And how high is the price you'll pay
For an ounce of truth that will fade away
And how hard will you hold on
To your freedom reign that will soon be gone
And how many fools will believe till they
Understand that we don't agree, and still...

Does anybody know what makes the wind blow

And can you tell me why the rain falls from the sky
If we really want to know all the answers
And why does the sun warm each and every heart
These are questions we can't answer
Till we open up and find the Treasures of Heaven
Treasures of Heaven

Just think about it for a short moment
Think about the Treasures of Heaven

Does anybody know what makes the wind blow
And can you tell me why the rain falls from the sky
Why each and every one of us has the right to choose between
Darkness and light

Does anybody know how the moon controls the tide
Why You had to come and die for me
If we really want to know all the answers
It will always be a mystery why You gave Your only Son for me
Till we open up and find the Treasures of Heaven
