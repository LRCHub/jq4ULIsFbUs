You don't even try to know how I feel
Stop keep asking me if I am for real
When I fall to the ground
And there's no one around
I bet you'll do nothing for me, I know
If you find some treasures in my yard
Believe me
You can keep it as your master card
Did you find some treasures in my yard?
It's not easy, Mr greedy the sun goes down
Did you find love? Things you call love
Did you find something nice in my yard?
I scream it "Oh Lord, have mercy!"
"Oh Lord, have mercy!"
"Please help this man who tries to hurt me"
頭ん中　マネー　金　誰の為 オリジナル気取りで誰の真似
言い逃れの術こさえることより堪えることへ舵取れ 勝ち取れ　奪うことを止め
祈れ　疑うことを止め 何もかも if it's all the same
Why can't you forget her name?
Did you find love? Things you call love
Did you find something nice in my yard?
I scream it "Oh Lord, have mercy!"
"Oh Lord, have mercy!"
"Please help this man who tries to hurt me"
You want to know what's in my bedroom closet
Not something like a ship or a rocket
Too bad, exceed your budget
You can't find it in the market
If you find some treasures in my yard
Believe me
You can keep it as your master card
Did you find some treasures in my yard?
It's not easy, Mr greedy the sun goes down
Did you find love? Things you call love
Did you find something nice in my yard?
I'll pray for you, pray for you
I'll never curse you, what a sad man
Then I scream it "Oh Lord, have mercy!"
"Oh Lord, have mercy!"
"Please help this man who tries to hurt me"
